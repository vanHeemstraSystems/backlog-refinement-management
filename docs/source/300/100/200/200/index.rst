Create Refinement Events in Microsoft Teams
===============================================

In Microsoft Teams, from the Calendar tab, choose "New event".

Make sure you select the calendar of the team you are creating a Sprint event for (e.g. Team IT 1: DS Cloud) which you created earlier.

Name the Refinement "Team" + blank space + "DEPARTMENT NAME" + "TEAM NUMBER" + ":" + blank space+ "SERVICE NAME" + blank space + "NICKNAME" + blank space + "-" + blank space + "Refinement".

Where:

- "DEPARTMENT NAME": the name of the department the team is part of, e.g. for "Information Technology" us "IT".
- "TEAM NUMBER": the number of the team for easy of distinguishing between teams.
- "SERVICE NAME": the service the department of which team is part of e.g. for "Developer Services" use "DS".
- "NICKNAME": the name the team uses to be called. For e.g. a Cloud-technology oriented team, use "Cloud".

Example: Team IT 1: DS Cloud - Refinement

Set the Start Date to the first day of the Sprint and set a Start and End Time somewhere during that working day (preferably lasting for no more than 30 minutes). Choose for the event to be a repeating event on a biweekly basis (if your Sprint runs for two weeks), either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. 

If the time of the Sprint Review does not change during Sprints, you can set the End Date to the very end of the last Sprint of the Year. Otherwise set the End Date to the last day of the last Sprint of the Quarter.

Note: This is NOT and "All day" event.

Recommended: Good practise is to hold your Refinement at the start of your Sprint.

See [Backlog refinement: what is it and how do you approach it?](https://www.sienn.com/backlog-refinement-what-is-it-and-how-do-you-approach-it).

Sprint planning takes place at the start of each sprint. 

[Backlog refinement needs to happen before each sprint planning meeting which is usually every two weeks](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlog-refinement). Most teams need about 30 minutes to walk through the process. 

During the backlog refinement, the work for the next sprints is well prepared. You can apply the process on an ad-hoc basis if necessary. 
It is a continuous process that helps to keep the backlog relevant, up-to-date and executable.

The Calendar Event of the Refinement could have directions to the physical meeting place or a link online meeting for ease of attending.
